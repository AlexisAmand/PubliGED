This demonstrates a GoJS diagram rendered by Puppeteer.

With Node 8 or higher and npm, install puppeteer:
```
$ npm install puppeteer
```

Run script with:
```
$ node puppet.js
```

There are additional samples in this directory:
```
node puppet2.js
```
and
```
node renderSvg.js
```

Each sample writes out different files in this directory.
